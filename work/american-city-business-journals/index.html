                <p>When I started working with American City Business Journals, they had 40 cities (and 40 apps) along with a mobile web experience that needed some help growing. I came in to lead the experience and design effort.</p>

                <figcaption class="text-center subtle col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">Bizjournals, optimzied for iOS 7.</figcaption>


                <h2 class="subheader subheader-dark text-center">Making the app</h2>

                <p>The first thing we did was to move away from an outside vendor and combined the 40 apps into one big, beautiful experience. People weren’t obligated to download multiple apps to access news in various cities, now they’re able to get it in one spot.</p>
                <p>Moving our apps in-house gave us better control and the ability to improve whenever we wanted. I was able to give due attention to improving the visual hierarchy and employing good typographic practices to make for a better reading experience.</p>
                <p>Attempting to blur the lines between native and web isn’t an easy task, but we sure tried (and keep trying). Our apps are a mix of iOS-native components and web views. Navigation and sharing tools were written for iOS while the article lists and article pages were built in HTML that we could update whenever we needed. We optimized as much as we could to make it as snappy as possible. (The next version’s going to be even better.)</p>
                <p>Having the same content across all our platforms was important and we used our mobile experience as a way to pare everything down as best we knew how and put the content first (mobile first is a good thing in so many ways, friend.). Since the small screens on mobile require laser focus, we were able to have better conversations about what fit on the page and what didn’t. This also helped us set the stage for a responsive site.</p>

                <h2 class="subheader subheader-dark text-center">iOS 7 and rebranding</h2>

                <picture class="img-buster">
                    <source srcset="/img/bizjournals-ios6-vs-ios7@2x.png" media="(min-width: 1200px)">
                        <source class="img-responsive" srcset="/img/bizjournals-ios6-vs-ios7.png, /img/bizjournals-ios6-vs-ios7@2x.png 2x">
                            <img class="img-responsive" srcset="/img/bizjournals-ios6-vs-ios7.png" alt="">
                </picture>
                <figcaption class="text-center subtle col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">How we evolved from iOS 6 to iOS 7. We got everything else out of the way to focus on the content. Larger images, better typography, and a fresher feel.</figcaption>


                <p>The company also went through a rebranding process for each of its markets. It was huge, and took over a year to roll out. iOS 7 was the perfect opportunity to carry their new branding principles over to the app. We further refined the look of the app by removing all textures, big gradients, and anything else that felt like cruft. We also implemented their new typefaces to make it feel more in line with their printed newspaper.</p>
                <p>We had this in the store the day iOS 7 was released.</p>

                <h2 class="subheader subheader-dark text-center">Feedback</h2>

                <picture class="img-buster">
                    <source srcset="/img/bizjournals-ratings@2x.png" media="(min-width: 1200px)">
                        <source class="img-responsive" srcset="/img/bizjournals-ratings.png, /img/bizjournals-ratings@2x.png 2x">
                            <img class="img-responsive" srcset="/img/bizjournals-ratings.png" alt="">
                </picture>
                <figcaption class="text-center subtle col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">We opened conversations with our users to improve our app and its rating.</figcaption>


                <p>We struggled a little with the first release but ended up with a huge turnaround. I wrote a little more about that on <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/06/26/a-better-way-to-request-app-ratings/">Smashing Magazine</a> but the gist is that we took a poorly-rated app and turned it into a 4.5-star rated app by asking users to tell us about their experience. Good experiences were asked to review us on the App Store, bad experiences were sent to a customer support team that helped frustrated users resolve their issues.
                </p>

                <h2 class="subheader subheader-dark text-center">Other mobile efforts</h2>

                <p>We looked hard at data to study usage patterns, checked our gut, and also did monthly usability tests to see how to improve things like our search experience. The results of our testing increased the number of successful searches.</p>
                <p>In keeping with the idea of a consistent experience, we’ve endeavored to make the app and website experience similar while retaining the sensibilties of each platform.</p>

                <picture class="img-buster">
                    <source srcset="/img/bizjournals-style-guide@2x.png" media="(min-width: 1200px)">

                </picture>
                <figcaption class="text-center subtle col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">We created a style guide in Sketch to help the app grow. It’s a work in progress.</figcaption>

                <p>Style guides and pattern libraries were critical to both the team and the company—we want the app to grow consistently, so we added a style guide for front-end code samples, typography, and copywriting. We also added a pared-down version for Sketch.</p>
                <p>We also sought to sought to improve user engagement as much as possible. One thing we did was implement article swiping. Doing so had a substantial increase in user engagement. I can’t share exact numbers, but let’s leave it at there was high fiving once we looked at the data.</p>
                <p>It was important for us to let mobile users have a tailored experience when purchasing products from our site. They needed to purchase event tickets and subscriptions, and we needed to allow each market to set their own prices and descriptions. Mobile transactions went up significantly as a direct result of launching this.</p>
