                    <p>
                    Think about how you can use technologies such as home automation and streaming media to transform a hotel stay to reflect an occupant’s preferences.</p>
                </div>

                <h3 class="text-center">Getting Started</h3>

                <p>I love traveling. It’s fun to experience a new place, but I do miss some things about home when I’m away. Here’s how I approached finding my ideal home away from home.</p>

                <p>What follows is a description of my process, some sketches, and a link to working prototypes.</p>

                <p>I started by asking lots of questions, brainstormed answers to those questions with lots of Post-Its, did product research, and also asked questions of others.</p>

                    <source srcset="/img/my-hotel-initial-questions@2x.png" media="(min-width: 1200px)">

                </figcaption>

                <p>Some of those initial questions were around what types of people the room might serve, what we miss when we're away from home, how we could use existing technology, and my favorite: what if this hotel were magic? More on that last question in a moment.</p>

                <p>While I found multiple types of people who travel, I focused on the solo traveler for this project. (There were some considerations for others with families, though.)</p>

                <p>I asked around to find out what people miss when they’re away from home. The replies were interesting and helped shape the course of the project. I also looked into what data sources we could tie into and created a list of opportunities.</p>

                </figcaption>

                <p>I wanted to visualize this challenge without constraints, so I asked this question: what my hotel would do if it were magic? Asking it proves helpful—it forces you to think less about what an existing API or service can do for you and lets you consider what could be.

                <p>I’ve heard a saying along the lines of “there are many possibilities in the beginner’s mind, but few in the expert’s,” and I want to think like both. That’s where things got really fun—and why that last graphic had so many ideas.</p>


                <h2 class="subheader subheader-dark text-center">Visualizing the experience</h2>

                <p>After brainstorming, I wondered what kind of digital experience this would be. An app? Yes, but it only feels like part of the picture. An app could act as the control panel, allowing someone to add and control new services. The rest of the experience feels like it would be invisible, like the best parts of home just magically came with you.</p>

                <picture class="img-buster">

                </figcaption>

                <h3 class="text-center">The room itself</h3>

                <p>Several areas immediately come to mind when wanting to take parts of my home with me:
                    <strong>security, lighting, climate, and media.</strong>
                </p>

                <p>I could use my device to get into and control the room just like I do at home, negating the need for physical keys and weird remote controls. An additional benefit: if I kept my device with me, it could help keep my kids from running out of the room if I took a nap.</p>

                <p>If I had a Nest and smart lighting system at home, the room could know my schedule, climate, and lighting preferences. When it’s time for bed, the lights will begin to dim and I’ll drift off peacefully.</p>

                <h3 class="text-center">Screens &amp; Speakers</h3>

                <picture class="img-buster">
                    <source srcset="/img/my-hotel-tv@2x.png" media="(min-width: 1200px)">
                        <source class="img-responsive" srcset="/img/my-hotel-tv.png, /img/my-hotel-tv@2x.png 2x">
                            <img class="img-responsive" srcset="/img/my-hotel-tv.png" alt="">
                </picture>
                <figcaption class="text-center subtle col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">What the TV interface could be. <a href="/img/my-hotel-tv@2x.png">(Full size)</a>
                </figcaption>

                <p>The television can pull in my media from all my providers—Netflix, Hulu, iTunes, Play, and even what’s on my device. If I’m watching Game of Thrones on the flight, I can easily pick up where I left off or even beam my show directly to the screen.</p>

                <p>The room would also allow me to play my music over the in-room speakers just like I could at home without any hassle.</p>

                <p>The wall art could be a big screen showing art from my favorite artists (or locals doing something equivalent).</p> 

                <p>A photo frame by my bed could be filled with my favorite family photograph, say from my cover photo on my social network profile.</p>

                <h3 class="text-center">Eating</h3>

                <p>Diets are hard to stick to when going out of town. I can’t always go to the grocery store or farmer’s market to pick up their favorite food, especially if I’m in another part of the world. What if my shopping list and food preferences helped my hotel stock my favorite foods or something comparable?</p>

                <picture class="img-buster">
                    <source srcset="/img/my-hotel-dining@2x.png" media="(min-width: 1200px)">

                </figcaption>

                <p>The room’s menu could also be customized to fit my diet, just like my pantry at home. If I’m a vegetarian, the hotel may recommend the black bean burger. If I do paleo, the giant hunk of steak.</p>

                <p>I’ve got my list of go-to restaurants at home, and the hotel could recommend food nearby that fits my preferences.</p>

                <h3 class="text-center">Sleeping</h3>

                <p>The room could know I prefer to have a little white noise going to help me drift of and begin to play it through the in-room speakers. It can shut off once it knows I’m asleep.</p>

                <p>The room could also know my sleeping preferences, like how I prefer a softer pillow and firm mattress.</p>

                <h3 class="text-center">Showering</h3>

                <p>When I go to shower, the room knows my desired temperature range in the shower. All I have to do is figure out how to turn the shower on (it’s too bad this exercise didn’t cover redesigning the shower interface—I’ve never stayed in a hotel where shower faucets operate the same way).</p>

                </figcaption>

                <p>For the prototype, I’m focusing on the phone being a control panel and onboarding an existing user who just got a new Nest (I also provided a second, more polished version if you’re interested).</p>

                <h2 class="text-center subheader subheader-dark">Closing thoughts</h2>

                <p>We spend lots of time getting our home right. We like our media instantly accessible, the temperature and lights just so. With all the data and connected services we have, it’s easy to see how we could take them with us. It’s also interesting to consider how the digital bits we share could be used to shape the physical objects in our room.</p>

                <p>It was also fun to think about how devices can work with each other to form a tighter complimentary experience, one that’s nearly invisible to the person using it. If this hotel ever exists, I’m pretty sure I’ll just want to move in there.</p>
