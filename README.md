*How it's built*

Built with Bootstrap and Grunt.js.

I used Grunt to concatenate my JavaScript and CSS files into one file for load speed optimization. It also let me create a local server where I could test, and I installed Dandelion to push code from a remote repository to my site.

Bootstrap provided a flexible framework for the HTML and CSS that I was able to modify easily. I trimmed lots of bloat from Bootstrap's CSS and JS (about 50%) so that browsers don't have excess code to process.
